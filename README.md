# Text_Generation_N-Gram
This project was executed as a school assignment at the University of Twente. For this project was a N-gram model created in Python by our project group. This was used to generate original Lord of the Rings texts based on all Lord of the Rings books. These new texts were then used in an enquete to test this model against a trained GPT-2 model and real texts from the books itself. This was finally all delivered in a project report.
